Plink Plonk presents Sign Sprinter!

A multiplayer sign language game where players race against each other to complete random sign language challenges as quickly as possible. The game includes a login and signup system, supporting both traditional email authentication and Google OAuth. Players can either host a lobby or join existing lobbies, which can be public or private. Public lobbies are listed on the "View Lobbies" page, while private lobbies require an invite code to join. In the lobby, players can customize their nicknames. The game begins when the host clicks the "Start" button, launching a race to complete the sign challenges. Players can communicate via an integrated chat and enable their webcams for real-time sign language detection. A dynamic progress tracker displays each playerâ€™s progress throughout the game. The first player to successfully complete all sign language challenges wins, and participants have the option to replay the game for another round of fun and competition. If the host leaves the lobby, it is automatically destroyed, and all players are kicked out.
